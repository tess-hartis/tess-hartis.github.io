My name is Tess Hartis and I live in Houston, TX. This is my personal blog for exploration of topics in programming. These posts are summaries of my notes that I hope others may find interesting. By no means are my posts definitive explanations of any topic. Corrections or elaborations are encouraged and welcomed.

I also enjoy playing the violin, Irish fiddle, and piano. I play and perform music in a variety of settings in my free time.
